Project Overview
This project is designed to simulate the operations of a library, focusing on managing books, authors, customers, and transactions using SQL. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to create, manipulate, and manage a relational database, along with implementing advanced SQL queries and normalization techniques.

<b>>Project Structure</b>
1. Database Design
The database consists of several interconnected tables that represent different aspects of the library system. Below are the key tables:

Books: Stores information about books in the library.

Columns: BookID, Title, Genre, AuthorID, YearPublished
Authors: Contains information about authors.

Columns: AuthorID, FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth
Customers: Contains details about library customers.

Columns: CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone
Transactions: Stores records of issued and returned books.

Columns: TransactionID, BookID, CustomerID, IssueDate, ReturnDate
Genres: Defines the different genres available in the library.

Columns: GenreID, GenreName
2. SQL Operations
The project includes the following SQL operations to demonstrate the full capabilities of the system:

CRUD Operations:

Inserting new books, authors, customers, and genres.
Updating customer information (e.g., email or phone number).
Deleting old or damaged books.
Retrieving a list of books by a specific author or genre.
Advanced Queries:

Retrieve books that are currently issued and have not been returned.
Calculate the number of books issued by each customer.
Find the most popular genre based on book issues.
Get a list of all books with details on available copies.
3. Normalization
The database has been normalized to the following normal forms to avoid data redundancy:

1NF (First Normal Form)
2NF (Second Normal Form)
3NF (Third Normal Form)
4. Joins and Complex Queries
The system utilizes multiple types of joins to combine data from different tables:

INNER JOIN: Combining data from Books and Authors to list books and their respective authors.
LEFT JOIN: Retrieving all books, including those that have not been issued.
RIGHT JOIN: Finding customers who have not issued any books.
5. Indexes and Constraints
To improve query performance and ensure data integrity, the following techniques have been implemented:

Indexes on frequently queried columns such as BookID, CustomerID, and GenreID.
Foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity between tables.
6. Reports
Several reports have been created to provide useful insights:

List of books due for return.
Top authors based on the number of books issued.
List of top customers based on the number of books issued.
Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or SQL Server)
Tools: [Database Management System of choice]
How to Use
Clone the repository.
Set up the database using the provided schema.
Use SQL queries to interact with the data, perform CRUD operations, and generate reports.
Optionally, integrate with a front-end application for visualization.
